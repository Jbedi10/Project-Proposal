Although the sample size of ads was heavily favored in the beer category we can see that the other categories followed the same trend. Not as drastically, but it does look like celebrities were not getting their fame from super bowl ads from the year 2000-2020.\n\n\n\nThis graph depicts the use of ‘Sex Appeal’ in all brands studied in this sample. In the year 2000-2009 it looks like brands were using this to attract consumers as this number of ads was hovering around the 50% mark. From then on it has drastically decreased as brands have found other ways of promoting their products. It seems that sex appeal does not have much consumer pull as it once had in the early 2000’s.\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  AdTime Frequency Proportion\n   <dbl>     <int>      <dbl>\n1     30       119     0.490 \n2     60        70     0.288 \n3     45        22     0.0905\n4     75        11     0.0453\n5     15         8     0.0329\n6    120         7     0.0288\n7     90         3     0.0123\n8    100         3     0.0123\n\n\n\n\nFor years 2000-2020 it seems that animal use is not as frequent as one may think. Although everyone loves the Budweiser horses and puppy, not many other brands are using animals to promote their product.\n\n\n\nFrom the year 2000-2020 it seems that super bowl ads have used humor in most of their ads. With almost 70% of the ads sampled, humor is included. From personal experience it does seem humor has found its way into a lot of ads, even outside of super bowl viewing. It will be interesting to see if this trend continues or if there will be another type of ad that takes over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
