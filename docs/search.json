Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.\nWhen you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\nsummary(cars)\n##      speed           dist       \n##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00\n\n\nIncluding Plots\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
