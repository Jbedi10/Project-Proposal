title: "STA 518 Final Project"
description: |
  In our final project, we will investigate superbowl ads from 2000 to 2020 using a data set from Five Thirty Eight. We will make a website or application that displays trends of brandsâ€™ advertisement strategies over time and use predictive modeling/ simulations to anticipate which direction superbowl ads will go in the future. Here is our link to the Main dataset (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/superbowl-ads/blob/main/superbowl-ads.csv) and here is the link to the cost per second for ad (https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/super-bowl-commercials-cost-2022/v9ytfqzx74pjrcdvxyhevlzd)
  Check out our other tabs labeled "Cost Analysis" and "Ad Themes"!
