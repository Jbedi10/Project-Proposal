  In our final project, we will investigate superbowl ads from 2000 to 2020 using a data set from Five Thirty Eight. We will make a website or application that displays trends of brandsâ€™ advertisement strategies over time and use predictive modeling/ simulations to anticipate which direction superbowl ads will go in the future.
